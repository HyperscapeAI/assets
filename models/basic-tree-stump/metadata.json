  "detailedPrompt": "Generate a hyper-realistic 3D asset of a freshly chopped tree stump. The stump should display a cylindrical form with a rough, uneven top surface, imitating the irregular pattern created by an axe. The texture should be highly-detailed, showcasing the coarse fibrous grain of the wood, with visible age rings and splinters around the edges. The bark should be richly textured, with a coarse, grooved appearance and a deep, earthy brown color. The stump's base should be rooted in a patch of textured, green grass. No additional objects like an axe or leaves should be present.",
